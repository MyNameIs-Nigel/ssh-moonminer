# rest of the hardening (non-root, read-only rootfs, dropped capabilities)
# is unchanged and enforced in docker-compose.yml.

# comes from an MC_HOST_* env var, so without this every `mc` call in
# entrypoint.sh fails with "Unable to save new mc config" — silently, since
# entrypoint.sh redirects mc's stderr to /dev/null. /tmp is already
# world-writable in the base image.
