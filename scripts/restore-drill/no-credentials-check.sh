# Confirms entrypoint.sh's dev-mode branch: with no LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL set,
# local dev and CI must never require AWS/MinIO credentials or attempt any
# network call to S3 — they just run the game directly. Run with
# --network none: if the entrypoint ever tried an S3/MinIO call in dev mode it
# would hang or fail here, since there is no network to reach it on. A stronger
# proof than grepping logs alone.
#
# Usage: ./no-credentials-check.sh
# Requires Docker. Exits non-zero on any failure.
